      Who I am
    </div>
    <div>
      I want to start this out by saying I'm a giant nerd.
      I am curious about EVERYTHING and constantly seek out all types of knowledge.
      I mostly focus my learning on topics that are
      related to development, design, or marketing.

    <div>
      Learning is one thing, sharing is another. I take it on as a
      personal mission to teach others how to do the things that I do.
      In fact, I was a lead instructor for a Grand Circus bootcamp
      in the Spring of 2019 in Grand Rapids MI.

    <div>
      I love getting involved in the community. If you're into technology,
      design, or community giving, there's a pretty good chance we have
      or will run into each other at one of the many events or meetups
      Grand Rapids has to offer.
